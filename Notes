Current Tasks:
* check other values of epsilon min (lower values, 0.03, 0.05)
* check gamma values (0.10,0.05)
* try and change the batch size to update less frequently (every 200 rounds or something)
* test deeper and shallower architectures.

TODOs:  (after current)

* if we're score_scope away from the end - stop exploration to maximize results
* all tests should be against 4 avoid agents
